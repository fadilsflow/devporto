## Setting Up Your Website Icon (Favicon)

A favicon is the small icon that appears in browser tabs and bookmarks. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create or prepare a square image for your favicon (minimum 260x260 pixels)
2. Go to [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon-generator/nextjs) - this tool will create all the favicon files you need
3. Upload your image and follow the simple customization options
4. Click "Generate" and download the favicon package
5. Extract the favicon files to:
   - `app` folder - Files that follow Next.js conventions will have HTML markup automatically generated
   - `public` folder - Static favicon files that need to be publicly accessible
6. The favicons are already configured in `app/config/seo.ts` - no changes needed unless you used different file names

That's it! Your website will now show your custom icon across all browsers and devices.
